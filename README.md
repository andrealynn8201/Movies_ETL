# Movies_ETL

I was tasked to create an automated pipeline that took in new data, performs the appropriate transformations and loads the data to existing tables.  I needed to refractor the code to create one function that takes in three files:

* Wikipedia data
* Kaggle metadata
* MovieLens rating data

In order to complete this, I needed to perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.  Included are some images in the resource file that shows the data was added to the PostgreSQL database successfully.
